plugin-item-success
===================

This plugin modifies the listings publication flow and adds a final thanks page. In this way, users will get a confirmation that their ad has been published. 

Furthermore, they will be able to share the listing on social networks and choose if they want to publish another listing or just keep browsing.

NOTE: thanks page will only be shown if listings are validated by default.
